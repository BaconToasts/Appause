## Product Description:
### Our product is a mobile application that our client Mr. Brimberry and his students at Encina Preparatory High School can download onto their phones.

### Once our client downloads the application and logs in, he is greeted with the screen above where he can be able to generate a class code for the students to join, accept or deny requests sent to him, manage users, alter settings, lock or unlock all apps in case of exams, and logout.

### The view above showcases when our client can either approve or deny requests that were sent by a particular student.
### One important note about our product is that it is limited to Apple iPhones. We have limited experience with application development and our client and his students mostly use Apple devices so we focused primarily on the most convenient option for our client.
## Reason for creating/using our product:
### Our client Matthew Brimberry wanted a way to make sure that his students could be able to pay attention to the material that he covers in his classes whether it be certain topics to be on a quiz or general safety instructions since he teaches chemistry and has to occasionally deal with hazardous chemicals.

# Timeline for CSC 191 (Rough outline up to sprint 7):
## Sprint 5:
### We plan to work on the backend of our application to allow for the connectivity betweeen our client's phone and those of his students.
## Sprint 6:
### Then we plan to focus on the lockdown/restriction features of our app as well as the student's ability to send requests to Mr. Brimberry.
## Sprint 7:
### We plan to add in the ability for our client to either accept or deny the requests sent to him by the students and thus either restrict or grant access to the app in question.
