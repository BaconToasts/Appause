<h2>Project Overview: Mobile Application for Classroom Focus</h1>
<p>Welcome to our innovative iOS application designed to empower educators like Mr. Brimberry to maintain a focused and distraction-free learning environment. Although the project has faced development delays beyond our control, we are excited to share our vision for enhancing classroom engagement.</p>

<h2>Product Description:</h2>
<p>Our mobile application is tailored to address the challenges faced by educators, enabling them to regulate students' access to non-educational phone applications seamlessly. Specifically designed for teachers like Mr. Brimberry, the app facilitates a structured communication channel between students and teachers.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Inspiration:</h2>
<p>Our project was born out of a sincere concern raised by Mr. Brimberry. He sought a solution to spare students from the repetitive task of putting away their phones during lectures. His vision was simple yet profound: to create an environment where students could genuinely engage with the course material, whether preparing for quizzes or absorbing crucial safety instructions during his Chemistry lab.</p>

<h2>Testing:</h2>
<p>The testing procedures for the application are documented in the following folders: "Project190Tests" for unit tests and "Project190UITests" for UI tests. To execute these tests and evaluate the application, ensure that Xcode is installed on your Mac device. Navigate to the relevant test file and initiate the test by clicking on the diamond symbol located next to the corresponding test function in that file. This process executes the respective unit or UI test, providing results on whether the test has passed or failed.</p>

<h2>Deployment:</h2>
<p> While the app has yet to be deployed, we have detailed the process of how the next group should go about doing so. To fully deploy this app to the iOS App Store, a review request must be sent to verify that the app meets all of Apple's developer guidelines for apps looking to be added to the App Store. All of the relevant information can be found here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/">https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/</a> </p>

<h2>Future Implementation:</h2>
<p>Regrettably, due to unforeseen development delays, the project is not yet complete. However, we are committed to ensuring its continuity. The reins will be passed on to a new senior project group, poised to implement advanced features, including a comprehensive lockdown functionality.</p>
