<h2>Product Description:</h2>
<h3>Our product is a mobile application that teachers like our client Mr. Brimberry can use to limit their students' access to non-educational phone apps. Essentially students would need to send requests that the teacher can then either approve fully or temporarily or deny access altogether as shown in Figures 2, and 3</h3>
<h3>The reason for creating our product was because our client wanted a way to make sure that his students could be able to pay attention to the material that he covers in his classes whether it be certain topics to be on a quiz or general safety instructions without having to constantly remind his students to put their phones away during lectures.</h3>

<h3>One important note about our product is that it is limited to Apple iPhones. We have limited experience with application development and our client and his students mostly use Apple devices so we focused primarily on the most convenient option for our client.</h3>
<h2>Testing:</h2>
<h3>The test scripts can be found in these folders Project190Tests and Project190UITests. As for how you are supposed to run them and test the app you need to have installed XCode on your Mac device* and then go to the respected test file and click on a diamond right next to the test function in that file. That runs the respective unit/UI test and will run until it has either passed or failed. </h3>

<h2>Deployment:</h2>
<h3> To fully deploy this app to the iOS App Store, a review request must be sent to verify that the app meets all of Apple's developer guidelines for apps looking to be added to the App Store. All of the relevant information can be found here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/">https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/</a> </h3>
